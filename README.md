## Description
This project is part of 42 security branch, from a pentesting/CTF point of view.
We are provided with a specific iso to work on, where we will work our way from level 0 to 9 for the mandatory part of the project, then we may chose to also work on the optional 4 levels.
We are to provide a walkthrough for each level, explaining how we manage to find the flag. We also provide all scripts that we used, and the flag on a separate file.




## Some extre info
First, if IP address is 10.x.x.x, make sure that the VM network adapter settings is set to 'host-only'.
